        <h2>
            Process
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started my process by gathering the images, background and sounds 
            I knew I would need or wanted to include. I created all of my backgrounds in Photoshop 
            and also created the sprites using clip art and Photoshop. I knew I wanted a sound for 
            when Perry ran into an enemy and a sound for catching fish. Later I added a losing sound and a winning sound, 
            as well as a level up sound. I approched this project by going scene by scene and creating the code 
            logically from there. I also found that writing down the flow I wanted my game to have helped me quite a bit.
            I began with the start scene and learned the hard way that it was much easier to create backgrounds that 
            held the words and labels I needed instead of coding them in JS. After the start scene I stopped doing that.
            I ran into some issues where the level and life numbers wouldn't reset so that took some trial and error.
            One thing I wish I had time to improve is the accuracy of the intersection between Perry and the predators.
            I would also like to add more levels eventually and other obstacles as the game progresses, I restrained 
            from doing that now because I didn't want it to be too difficult for a family game. I used the Circle Blast 
            homework and instructions as a reference for this assignment, w3schools, as well as the PIXI tutorial videos that were 
            suggested, and I looked at past projects for inspiration in choosing my idea and theme.

            Concept Summary and Genre
        </h2>
        <p>
            The user will play as a penguin trying to get to a penguin party. The penguin will
            slide around the screen catching fish for life points, dodge predators that will cause 
            the penguin to lose life points and avoid icebergs and other obstacles along the way.
            This could be classified as a racing/family game. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Platform
        </h2>
        <p>
            My game will be created for desktop only.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Story/Theme
        </h2>
        <p>
            The story behind my game will be that there is a lost penguin trying to get to his friends
            penguin party. The user has to help him avoid polar bears and seals, while also catching enough
            fish to fuel him for his journey. There will be obstacles along the path that will cause the penguins
            journey to be interrupted. His journey will get progressively harder the closer he gets to the party.
            The mood for this game will be playful and exciting. The premise and player motivation 
            of the game is to reunite the penguin with his friends and help him get home to the penguin party.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Style
        </h2>
        <p>
            My graphics style will be cartoonish and fun. The background sound will be looped, exciting, fun and 
            motivating music. There will be a sound effect for when the penguin comes in contact with a predator and 
            when they catch a fish. The background music may also change when the user completes the game successfully.

        </p>
        <h2>
            Mechanics/Gameplay
        </h2>
        <p>
            The player will have to choose which obstacles are worth the risk or not. Certain predators will cause more damage
            than others and certain fish will increase health more than others. The player will learn how to play the game 
            via instructions on the opening screen before they start. They will also be informed then how to beat the game.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Controls
        </h2>
        <p>
            The user will control the penguin with the right and left arrow keys. They will be able to go left and right and possiblily 
            forward with the up key if the game ends up requiring it.
