    <h2 >Documentation - </h2>
    <p>
        I started my design process by looking at which API I wanted to use. I was stuck between upgrading gif-finder and
        using the dog API because the topics of the other APIs didn't interest me as much. I chose the dog API because I had 
        never worked with an API before and this one seemed like an easy way to start. I looked at the starters linked on the 
        project 2 github page for the dog API and also looked at the documentation on their website to see what I could do with it.
        I decided to give the user the ability to choose from a drop down list of dog breeds in order to avoid potential spelling 
        errors or user error if a textbox search was used. I got the image limit idea from the gif-finder homework and implemented that 
        into my design as well. The starters that were posted on the github helped me to code my random button so that the user 
        can generate a random dog photo. The ability to allow users to favorite images was more difficult, I decided that checkboxes
        would be the easiest way to select multiple images from a search result to add to a favorites group. I was unable to figure 
        out how to allow the user to uncheck the box and remove it from favorites, so I created a clear button instead.

       When coding the javascript for this project I broke it down into methods and went from there. I knew I needed a method for each
        button event as well as a method to add images to favorites and an onload function that would display the saved data. Writing pseudocode notes helped a lot,
        as did trial and error. The sources I used were the gif-finder homework, the tutorial videos and series, the dog API documentation/website and 
        w3schools for css and javascript suggestions. I believe I met the requirements because my project saves the last search in local storage, has
        more than 3 controls, handles errors, has valid css and html, uses let, const, and querySelectors. I think I should recieve a 85-95
        for my project. I would have liked to use something other than checkboxes to create favorites and have been able to figure out 
        how to unfavorite images but I didn't have enough time to do so.
